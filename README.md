# Anansi Tags

Apply simple BBCode-like tags to JS strings to get ANSI

_No frills.  No dependencies.  Just strings!_

_(NodeJS port of [anansi-tags](https://github.com/3digitdev/anansi-tags) Python package)_

## Installation

```shell
npm i --save anansi-tags
```

## Usage

This library aims to be as dead-simple as possible.  All functions take a string and return a string.  There are only 4 functions that you'll need to worry about as well, providing ways to convert back and forth between ANSI and the custom tags, and even to strip either ANSI or the tags from a string.

### Simple Usage

Basic tags can be handled in a nice simple way:

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parse_tags('[bold]Hello world[/bold]'));
```

You can make colored text.  Colored text ("foreground") is cancelled with `/fg`:

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[red]Hello world[/fg]'));
```

You can do background colors.  Background colors are cancelled with `/bg`:

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[bg_white]Hello world[/bg]'));
```

You can combine any of these to make some super complex tags too:
**Note:  You can cancel ALL formatting you have added so far with `[/]`!**

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[yellow bg_green italic]Oh god this is unreadable[/]'));
```

**Let's get CRAZY**:

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[yellow bg_green italic]Oh god this is [bold]unreadable[/bold /italic under] Please remove[/bg] the colors[/] oh thank you.'));
```

#### Hyperlinks

Anansi also supports hyperlinking, as long as your terminal does too:

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[link=https://github.com/3digitdev/anansi-tags]Anansi[/link] is a very simple library!'));
```

You can even style hyperlinks!

```js
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(parseTags('[link=https://github.com/3digitdev/anansi-tags][bold]Anansi[/][/link] is a very simple library!'));
```

**Note:  Remember that you can't combine `link` tags with any other type of tag!  They are incompatible.**

### ANSI-Strings â†’ Anansi Tags

This will work for all supported Anansi tags, including links:

```js
const { parseAnsi } = require('anansi-tags');

// Yep, ansi is ugly.
console.log(parseAnsi('\x1b[1mHello\x1b[22m'))
// Result:  '[bold]Hello[/bold]'
```

### Stripping Anansi Tags

```js
const { stripTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripTags('[bold]Hello[/bold]'))
// Result:  'Hello'
```

If you strip a hyperlink, by default it will remove the URL, leaving only the text:

```js
const { stripTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripTags('[link=www.google.com]A link to Google[/link]'))
// Result:  'A link to Google'
```

You can configure this behavior with `keepUrl`:

```js
const { stripTags } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripTags('[link=www.google.com]A link to Google[/link]', keepUrl=True))
// Result:  'www.google.com'
```

### Stripping ANSI codes

```js
const { stripAnsi } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripAnsi('\x1b[1mHello\x1b[22m'))
// Result:  'Hello'
```

Just like with `stripTags()`, stripping a hyperlink removes the URL, leaving only the text:

```js
const { stripAnsi } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripAnsi('\x1b]8;;www.google.com\x1b\x5cA link to Google\x1b]8;;\x1b\x5c'))
// Result:  'A link to Google'
```

Also, just like with `stripTags()`, you can tell `stripAnsi()` to only keep the URL:

```js
const { stripAnsi } = require('anansi-tags');

console.log(stripAnsi('\x1b]8;;www.google.com\x1b\x5cA link to Google\x1b]8;;\x1b\x5c', keepUrl=True))
// Result:  'www.google.com'
```

## Similar Librar(y/ies)

### [ansi-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-colors)

Honestly...I really think my interface for this is a lot more approachable.  Just looking at the comparison for nesting:

```js
// ansi-colors
const { bold, red, green } = require('ansi-styles');
console.log(red(`Hello ${bold('World')}, how are ${green('you')}?`))

// anansi-tags
const { parseTags } = require('anansi-tags');
console.log(parseTags('[red]Hello [bold]World[/bold], how are [green]you[/]?'))
```

I'm ~~probably~~ biased, but I feel like `anansi-tags` is a lot more readable for more complex formatting like this.

## FAQ

### Didn't you know that {other library} supports this?

I probably didn't tbh -- I didn't look too hard.  Odds are though that whatever library you're thinking of probably is much bigger with way more features and support and fanciness to it.  If that's better for you, then great!

### Why do you only support 8 colors??

Honestly, if you have a need for the difference between `216` ("light_salmon1") and `217` ("light_pink1"), it's likely that your needs are severely more complex than what I intended for this library.  I highly recommend you go check out libraries like [ansi-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-colors) instead!

### Why don't you support {other ANSI code}

Kinda the same reason as above?  There's a lot of ANSI stuff out there, and this library is really just for the most basic usage that you should usually need I think.

### {Supported ANSI code} isn't doing anything!

Yeah I added some in despite them not being widely supported.  Of note, I've found that `blink`, `frame`, `circle`, and `overline` all seem to just...do nothing for me too?  Using `iTerm` over here.  Maybe some support it so I wanted them as options I guess, but your mileage may vary, sorry!  Terminal standards are all over the place.

### My link is acting weird

I haven't done much thorough testing of links, and url-encoding is another complex standard.  If you find scenarios that don't work feel free to open an issue!  I can't promise I'll make supporting URL standards a full priority, but it doesn't hurt to ask!
